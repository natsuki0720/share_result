  "free_description": "This road section is likely intended as a local collector, balancing vehicular movement with some accommodation for pedestrians and cyclists, given the bicycle lane marking and presence of a narrow shoulder. Primary target users are local drivers, with secondary consideration for pedestrians and cyclists.Strengths include efficient mobility for local vehicular traffic and high visual comfort due to extensive, well-maintained greenery and street trees. However, safety for pedestrians is a significant weakness; the narrow, unpaved shoulder is inadequate, compromising their safety and comfort by placing them too close to traffic. The bicycle lane marking, while present, lacks physical separation, offering limited protection for cyclists. This constitutes a mismatch between the implied multi-modal intent and the actual provision, where pedestrian safety is notably under-prioritized. The street trees enhance the environment, but the lack of dedicated pedestrian infrastructure undermines the overall spatial functionality for active transport users. The tree-lined aspect may contribute to a sense of place and local scenic value."
