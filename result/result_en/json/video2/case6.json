  "free_description": "This road section is primarily designed as a local residential street, prioritizing the safety and comfort of residents, including pedestrians, cyclists, and local drivers. Mobility efficiency is moderate, serving local access effectively while a 30 km/h speed limit enhances safety. Structural characteristics include well-defined sidewalks and crosswalks, complemented by a pedestrian bridge, ensuring safe passage for non-vehicular users. The abundant and well-maintained greenery significantly contributes to visual comfort and a pleasant residential ambiance. Spatial elements like speed limit signs and bus stop benches are appropriately placed, fulfilling their intended roles. The road successfully aligns with its design intent, creating a livable community space. It holds cultural value as a central artery for an established residential area, supporting daily life and local commerce within a pleasant environment."
